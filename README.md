## Introduction

My-Space is a simple web application designed to assist users in tracking the articles they've read on the web. It allows you to enter the URL of an article, records that you've read it, and keeps a count of the articles you've visited. If you enter the link to an article you've already visited, it provides a disclaimer.

The data of the articles you've read is stored locally on your device, ensuring your privacy and convenience.
